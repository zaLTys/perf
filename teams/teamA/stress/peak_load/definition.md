# Peak Load Stress Test

## Purpose
- Tests system under high sustained load
- Identifies maximum capacity and breaking points
- Validates system stability at peak traffic

## Test Type
**Stress Test** - Gradual ramp to high load, sustained peak

## Expected Outcome
- **Peak RPS**: ~300 req/s
- **Response Time**: p95 < 800ms
- **Success Rate**: > 95% (allows some degradation)
- **Duration**: ~6 minutes
